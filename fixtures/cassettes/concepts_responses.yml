        the 4 hour extraction of HCl, and the time trial data for 1 M HCl extractions.\n\nA
        regional survey of potential contaminants in marine or estuarine sediments
        is often one of the first steps in a post-disturbance environmental impact
        assessment. Of the many different chemical extraction or digestion procedures
        that have been proposed to quantify metal contamination, partial acid extractions
        are probably the best overall compromise between selectivity, sensitivity,
        precision, cost and expediency.  The extent to which measured metal concentrations
        relate to the anthropogenic fraction that is bioavailable is contentious,
        but is one of the desired outcomes of an assessment or prediction of biological
        impact.  As part of a regional survey of metal contamination associated with
        Australia''s past waste management activities in Antarctica, we wanted to
        identify an acid type and extraction protocol that would allow a reasonable
        definition of the anthropogenic bioavailable fraction for a large number of
        samples.  From a kinetic study of the 1 M HCl extraction of two certified
        Certified Reference Materials (MESS-2 and PACS-2) and two Antarctic marine
        sediments, we concluded that a 4 hour extraction time allows the equilibrium
        dissolution of relatively labile metal contaminants, but does not favour the
        extraction of natural geogenic metals.  In a regional survey of 88 marine
        samples from the Casey Station area of East Antarctica, the 4 h extraction
        procedure correlated best with biological data, and most clearly identified
        those sediments thought to be contaminated by runoff from abandoned waste
        disposal sites.  Most importantly the 4 hour extraction provided better definition
        of the low to moderately contaminated locations by picking up small differences
        in anthropogenic metal concentrations.  For the purposes of inter-regional
        comparison, we recommend a 4 hour 1 M HCl acid extraction as a standard method
        for assessing metal contamination in Antarctica.\n\nThe fields in this dataset

        steps taken to ensure quality of data.\n\nTo assess extraction efficiency
        for a range of sediment types, four marine sediments were analysed in detail.  Two
        international certified reference materials (CRMs) and two well-characterised
        Antarctic sediments were chosen to compare and contrast moderately to strongly
        contaminated samples (based on total metal digest), with clean samples of
        similar matrices.  One CRM was an uncontaminated continental shelf mud (MESS-2),
        and the other a contaminated harbour mud (PACS-2) (NRCC, 2002).  The two Antarctic
        sediments were collected as part of a regional hierarchical survey (Stark
        et al., 2003).  One Antarctic sample was from an area of known metal pollution
        in Brown Bay (BB), which is adjacent to the ''Old'' Casey Station waste disposal
        site (Snape et al., 2001; Stark et al., 2003).  The second Antarctic sample
        was from a non-impacted control site from O''Brien Bay (OBB), 3 km south of
        Casey Station and the disposal site (Fig. 1).  The Antarctic samples, OBB
        and BB, have similar matrices, proportions of mud (less than 63 microns; 19%
        and 22% respectively) and total organic carbon contents (1.9% and 2.3% respectively).
        Both MESS and PACS are sieved, homogenised and dried CRMs that have been ground
        to ~50 microns (NRCC, 2002).  In contrast, OBB and BB were only sieved to
        less than 2 mm, thereby removing only the very largest particles (less than
        or equal to 3%).  The Antarctic samples were collected using acid-washed PVC
        coring tubes.  The samples were kept frozen at -20 degrees C until wet-sieved
        with a small amount of clean filtered (0.45 microns cellulose nitrate) O''Brien
        Bay seawater through 2 mm nylon mesh held in a plastic sieve unit.  The sediments
        were then oven-dried to constant weight at 103 degrees C (Loring and Rantala
        1992), and stored in Nalgene HDPE bottles until analysis.","EntryTitle":"0.5

        MODIS level-2 atmospheric aerosol product (MYD04_L2) continues to provide
        full global coverage of aerosol properties from the Dark Target (DT) and Deep
        Blue (DB) algorithms. The DT algorithm is applied over ocean and dark land
        (e.g., vegetation), while the DB algorithm now covers the entire land areas
        including both dark and bright surfaces. Both results are provided on a 10x10
        pixel scale (10 km at nadir). Each MYD04_L2 product file covers a five-minute
        time interval. The output grid is 135 pixels in width by 203 pixels in length.
        Every tenth file has an output grid size of 135 by 204 pixels. MYD04_L2 product
        files are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS).Based on C5 validation
        studies, a number of Science Data Sets (SDSs) have been deleted from the DT
        product (Angstrom_Exponent_Land, Optical_Depth_Small_Land, etc.) while a number
        of SDSs have been renamed or added. A number of algorithm changes have lead
        to significant changes in regional aerosol product statistics (see link above).
        For C6, the DT algorithm team now provides a new 3 km spatial resolution product
        intended for the air quality community; this is provided in a separate file
        (M*D04_3K).In C5, the DB algorithm was limited to only bright targets. With
        C6, the DB team has expanded coverage to include both bright targets and vegetated
        regions, using NDVI information in addition to a precalculated surface reflectance
        database. New DB products for C6 include an estimate on the aerosol retrieval
        uncertainty to assist with error analyses as well as a best estimate SDS containing
        the aerosol optical thickness data with quality assurance flags already applied
        (SDS names Deep_Blue_Aerosol_Optical_Depth_550_Land_Estimated_Uncertainty
        and Deep_Blue_Aerosol_Optical_Depth_550_Land_Best_Estimate respectively).
        In addition to separate DT and DB retrievals, the C6 product now provides
        a merged (SDS) that combines both types of retrievals (SDS name AOD_550_Dark_Target_Deep_Blue_Combined).
        This SDS uses a combination of scene NDVI and retrieval Quality Assessment
        (QA) assignments to select one of the retrievals (if any) or an average of
        the two retrievals. Ocean retrievals from the DT algorithm are also provided
        if they have a sufficiently high retrieval QA value.The file consists of following
        pixel level gridded aerosol parameters. These pixel level gridded aerosol
        parameters are stored as Scientific Data Sets(SDS) within the file:MODIS Data

        instrument aboard the Terra satellite has a complement of three different
        telescopes with varying pointing capabilities. ASTER data are primarily acquired
        and processed in support of a global mapping mission, and based on Data Acquisition
        Requests (DARs) from authorized users. ASTER Level-1 data are produced at
        the Ground Data System (GDS) facility of Japan Space Systems in Tokyo, Japan,
        and subsequently sent to the Land Processes (LP) Distributed Active Archive
        Center (DAAC) for archiving, distribution, and higher-level product generation.
        The ASTER Level-1A data set contains reconstructed, instrument digital numbers
        (DNs) derived from the telemetry streams of the 3 telescopes: Visible Near
        Infrared (VNIR), Shortwave Infrared (SWIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR). The
        Level-1A data contains depacketized, demultiplexed, and realigned instrument
        image data with their geometric correction coefficients and radiometric calibration
        coefficients calculated and appended but not applied. It also includes corrections
        for the SWIR parallax, and intra- and inter-telescope registration information.
        \r\n\r\nUsers are advised that ASTER SWIR data acquired from late April 2008
        to the present exhibit anomalous saturation of values and anomalous striping.
        This effect is also present for some prior acquisition periods. Please refer
        to the ASTER SWIR User Advisory Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/aster/docs/ASTER_SWIR_User_Advisory_July%2018_08.pdf)

        2000 Pilot Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) is an exploratory effort
        to construct an   index that measures the ability of a nation''s economy to
        achieve sustainable development, with the long term goal of finding a single   indicator
        for environmental sustainability analagous to that of the Gross Domestic Product
        (GDP). The index covering 56 countries is   a composite measure of the current
        status of a nation''s environmental systems, pressures on those systems, human
        vulnerability to   environmental change, national capacity to respond, and
        contributions to global environmental stewardship. The index was unveiled
        at   the World Economic Forum''s annual meeting, January 2000, Davos, Switzerland.
        The 2000 Pilot ESI is the result of collaboration among   the World Economic
        Forum (WEF), Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), and the
        Columbia University Center for   International Earth Science Information Network

        MODIS Version 6 Data Collection Processing and  Reprocessing","ISOTopicCategories":["CLIMATOLOGY/METEOROLOGY/ATMOSPHERE"],"ShortName":"MOD04_L2","Abstract":"The
        MODIS/Terra Aerosol 5-Min L2 Swath 10km (MOD04_L2) product continues to provide
        full global coverage of aerosol properties from the Dark Target (DT) and Deep
        Blue (DB) algorithms. The DT algorithm is applied over ocean and dark land
        (e.g., vegetation), while the DB algorithm now covers the entire land areas
        including both dark and bright surfaces. Both results are provided on a 10x10
        pixel scale (10 km at nadir). Each MOD04_L2 product file covers a five-minute
        time interval. The output grid is 135 pixels in width by 203 pixels in length.
        Every tenth file has an output grid size of 135 by 204 pixels. MOD04_L2 product
        files are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS).\n\nBased on C5 validation
        studies, a number of Science Data Sets (SDSs) have been deleted from the DT
        product (Angstrom_Exponent_Land, Optical_Depth_Small_Land, etc.) while a number
        of SDSs have been renamed or added. A number of algorithm changes have lead
        to significant changes in regional aerosol product statistics (see link above).
        For C6, the DT algorithm team now provides a new 3 km spatial resolution product
        intended for the air quality community; this is provided in a separate file
        (M*D04_3K).\n\nIn C5, the DB algorithm was limited to only bright targets.
        With C6, the DB team has expanded coverage to include both bright targets
        and vegetated regions, using NDVI information in addition to a precalculated
        surface reflectance database. New DB products for C6 include an estimate on
        the aerosol retrieval uncertainty to assist with error analyses as well as
        a best estimate SDS containing the aerosol optical thickness data with quality
        assurance flags already applied (SDS names Deep_Blue_Aerosol_Optical_Depth_550_Land_Estimated_Uncertainty
        and Deep_Blue_Aerosol_Optical_Depth_550_Land_Best_Estimate respectively).
        In addition to separate DT and DB retrievals, the C6 product now provides
        a merged (SDS) that combines both types of retrievals (SDS name AOD_550_Dark_Target_Deep_Blue_Combined).
        This SDS uses a combination of scene NDVI and retrieval Quality Assessment
        (QA) assignments to select one of the retrievals (if any) or an average of
        the two retrievals. Ocean retrievals from the DT algorithm are also provided
        if they have a sufficiently high retrieval QA value.\n\nThe aerosol poduct
        is used to study aerosol climatology, sources and sinks of specific aerosol
        types (e.g. sulfates and biomass burning aerosol), interaction of aerosols
        with clouds, and atmospheric corrections of remotely sensed surface reflectance
        over the land. This product will also be used to monitor aerosol mass concentration,
        aerosol optical properties, and radiative forcing on a global scale.\n\n  \nSee

        MODIS/Aqua Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 1km (MYD021KM) product contains
        calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 discrete bands located
        in the 0.4 to 14.4 micron region of electromagnetic spectrum. These data are
        generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance which during processing
        converted to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr). In addition, the Earth Bi-directional
        Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) may be determined for the solar reflective
        bands (1-19, 26) through knowledge of the solar irradiance (e.g., determined
        from MODIS solar diffuser data, and from the target illumination geometry).  Additional
        data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration
        data.\n\nVisible, shortwave infrared, and near infrared measurements are only
        made during the daytime, while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands
        20-25, 27-36) are measured continuously.\n\nThe Shortname for this product
        is MYD021KM and is stored in the Earth Observing System Hierarchical Data
        Format (HDF-EOS).\n\nEnvironmental information derived from MODIS L1B measurements
        will offer a comprehensive and unprecedented look at terrestrial, atmospheric,
        and ocean phenomenology for a wide and diverse community of users throughout
        the world.\n\nSee the MODIS Characterization Support Team webpage for more

        AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard
        deviations and input counts.  Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours
        for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local
        time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time)
        orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward
        (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded
        cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The
        two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3
        files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always
        coincident in time.  The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the
        date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map
        with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered.
        This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the
        right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding
        scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level
        3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths
        where there is no coverage for that day.The geophysical parameters have been
        averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude
        and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point
        mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard
        deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides
        the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean
        and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products.The
        thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air
        Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause
        Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud
        Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity,
        Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.The trace gases parameters are:
        Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone.The
        actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the
        Processing File Description document.(The Shortname for this product is AIRX3STD).","orbit_parameters":{},"id":"C1200187767-EDF_OPS","has_formats":true,"original_format":"ECHO10","archive_center":"GESDISC","browse_flag":false,"online_access_flag":true,"links":[{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"ftp://acdisc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/data/s4pa/Aqua_AIRS_Level3/AIRX3STD.006/"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/mirador/homepageAlt.pl?keyword=AIRX3STD"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/SSW/#keywords=AIRX3STD006"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/#utf8=%E2%9C%93&spatial_map=satellite&spatial_type=rectangle&keywords=GES_DISC_AIRX3STD_V006"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://disc1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/wms_airs?service=WMS&version=1.1.1&request=GetCapabilities"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://disc1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/wms_airs?service=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&SRS=EPSG:4326&WIDTH=720&HEIGHT=360&LAYERS=AIRX3STD_TOTH2OVAP_A&TRANSPARENT=TRUE&FORMAT=image/png&bbox=-180,-90,180,90"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://acdisc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/wcsAIRSL3?service=WCS&version=1.0.0&request=GetCapabilities"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://acdisc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/wcsAIRSL3?service=WCS&version=1.0.0&request=GetCoverage&CRS=EPSG:4326&format=netCDF&resx=1.0&resy=1.0&BBOX=-179.5,-89.5,179.5,89.5&Coverage=AIRX3STD:CO_VMR_A&Time=2013-08-11"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/index.shtml"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"ftp://acdisc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa/Aqua_AIRS_Level3/AIRX3STD.006/doc/README.AIRS_V6.pdf"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"ftp://acdisc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa//Aqua_AIRS_Level3/AIRX3STD.006/doc/README.AIRS_V6.pdf"}]}'
