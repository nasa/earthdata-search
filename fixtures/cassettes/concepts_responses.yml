        are for the 0.5 hour extraction of HCl.\n\nSee also the metadata records for
        the 4 hour extraction of HCl, and the time trial data for 1 M HCl extractions.\n\nA
        regional survey of potential contaminants in marine or estuarine sediments
        is often one of the first steps in a post-disturbance environmental impact
        assessment. Of the many different chemical extraction or digestion procedures
        that have been proposed to quantify metal contamination, partial acid extractions
        are probably the best overall compromise between selectivity, sensitivity,
        precision, cost and expediency.  The extent to which measured metal concentrations
        relate to the anthropogenic fraction that is bioavailable is contentious,
        but is one of the desired outcomes of an assessment or prediction of biological
        impact.  As part of a regional survey of metal contamination associated with
        Australia''s past waste management activities in Antarctica, we wanted to
        identify an acid type and extraction protocol that would allow a reasonable
        definition of the anthropogenic bioavailable fraction for a large number of
        samples.  From a kinetic study of the 1 M HCl extraction of two certified
        Certified Reference Materials (MESS-2 and PACS-2) and two Antarctic marine
        sediments, we concluded that a 4 hour extraction time allows the equilibrium
        dissolution of relatively labile metal contaminants, but does not favour the
        extraction of natural geogenic metals.  In a regional survey of 88 marine
        samples from the Casey Station area of East Antarctica, the 4 h extraction
        procedure correlated best with biological data, and most clearly identified
        those sediments thought to be contaminated by runoff from abandoned waste
        disposal sites.  Most importantly the 4 hour extraction provided better definition
        of the low to moderately contaminated locations by picking up small differences
        in anthropogenic metal concentrations.  For the purposes of inter-regional
        comparison, we recommend a 4 hour 1 M HCl acid extraction as a standard method
        for assessing metal contamination in Antarctica.\n\nThe fields in this dataset

        only.  Years are correct.\n\nSee the referenced paper for full details on
        steps taken to ensure quality of data.\n\nTo assess extraction efficiency
        for a range of sediment types, four marine sediments were analysed in detail.  Two
        international certified reference materials (CRMs) and two well-characterised
        Antarctic sediments were chosen to compare and contrast moderately to strongly
        contaminated samples (based on total metal digest), with clean samples of
        similar matrices.  One CRM was an uncontaminated continental shelf mud (MESS-2),
        and the other a contaminated harbour mud (PACS-2) (NRCC, 2002).  The two Antarctic
        sediments were collected as part of a regional hierarchical survey (Stark
        et al., 2003).  One Antarctic sample was from an area of known metal pollution
        in Brown Bay (BB), which is adjacent to the ''Old'' Casey Station waste disposal
        site (Snape et al., 2001; Stark et al., 2003).  The second Antarctic sample
        was from a non-impacted control site from O''Brien Bay (OBB), 3 km south of
        Casey Station and the disposal site (Fig. 1).  The Antarctic samples, OBB
        and BB, have similar matrices, proportions of mud (less than 63 microns; 19%
        and 22% respectively) and total organic carbon contents (1.9% and 2.3% respectively).
        Both MESS and PACS are sieved, homogenised and dried CRMs that have been ground
        to ~50 microns (NRCC, 2002).  In contrast, OBB and BB were only sieved to
        less than 2 mm, thereby removing only the very largest particles (less than
        or equal to 3%).  The Antarctic samples were collected using acid-washed PVC
        coring tubes.  The samples were kept frozen at -20 degrees C until wet-sieved
        with a small amount of clean filtered (0.45 microns cellulose nitrate) O''Brien
        Bay seawater through 2 mm nylon mesh held in a plastic sieve unit.  The sediments
        were then oven-dried to constant weight at 103 degrees C (Loring and Rantala
        1992), and stored in Nalgene HDPE bottles until analysis.","EntryTitle":"0.5

        similar to that used by NSIDC to produce\nDMSP SSM/I polar brightness temperature
        and sea ice products. Each\nimage was ranked for areal coverage of particular
        seas and for degree\nof cloud coverage. Passes covering a large area are generally
        favored over shorter passes with less cloud cover. The data set was developed\nin
        support of the Office Of Naval Research Arctic Leads Accelerated\nResearch
        Initiative (Arctic Leads ARI). The aim of the Initiative was\nto develop a
        more thorough understanding of the oceanography,\nmeteorology, and ice dynamics

        MODIS/Terra Aerosol 5-Min L2 Swath 10km (MOD04_L2) product provides full global
        coverage of aerosol properties from the Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB)
        algorithms. The DT algorithm is applied over ocean and dark land (e.g., vegetation),
        while the DB algorithm now covers the entire land areas including both dark
        and bright surfaces. Both results are provided on a 10x10 pixel scale (10
        km at nadir). Each MOD04_L2 product file covers a five-minute time interval.
        The output grid is 135 pixels in width by 203 pixels in length. Every tenth
        file has an output grid size of 135 by 204 pixels. MOD04_L2 product files
        are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS).\n\nThe new Collection 6.1
        (C61) MOD04_L2 product is an improved version based on algorithm changes in
        Dark Target (DT) Aerosol retrieval over urban areas and uncertainty estimates
        for Deep Blue (DB) Aerosol retrievals.\n\nThe MODIS level-2 atmospheric aerosol
        product provides retrieved ambient aerosol optical properties, quality assurance,
        and other parameters, globally over ocean and land. In Collection 5 and in
        earlier collections, there was only one aerosol product (MOD04_L2) at 10km
        (at nadir) spatial resolution. Starting from C6, the Dark Target (DT) Aerosol
        algorithm team provided a new 3 km spatial resolution product (MOD04_3k) intended
        for the air quality community.\n\n\nFor more information visit the MODIS Atmosphere

        instrument aboard the Terra satellite has a complement of three different
        telescopes with varying pointing capabilities. ASTER data are primarily acquired
        and processed in support of a global mapping mission, and based on Data Acquisition
        Requests (DARs) from authorized users. ASTER Level-1 data are produced at
        the Ground Data System (GDS) facility of Japan Space Systems in Tokyo, Japan,
        and subsequently sent to the Land Processes (LP) Distributed Active Archive
        Center (DAAC) for archiving, distribution, and higher-level product generation.
        The ASTER Level-1A data set contains reconstructed, instrument digital numbers
        (DNs) derived from the telemetry streams of the 3 telescopes: Visible Near
        Infrared (VNIR), Shortwave Infrared (SWIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR). The
        Level-1A data contains depacketized, demultiplexed, and realigned instrument
        image data with their geometric correction coefficients and radiometric calibration
        coefficients calculated and appended but not applied. It also includes corrections
        for the SWIR parallax, and intra- and inter-telescope registration information.
        \r\n\r\nUsers are advised that ASTER SWIR data acquired from late April 2008
        to the present exhibit anomalous saturation of values and anomalous striping.
        This effect is also present for some prior acquisition periods. Please refer
        to the ASTER SWIR User Advisory Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/aster/docs/ASTER_SWIR_User_Advisory_July%2018_08.pdf)

        2008 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) centers on two broad environmental
        protection objectives: (1) reducing environmental stresses on human health,
        and (2) promoting ecosystem vitality and sound natural resource management.
        Derived from a careful review of the environmental literature, these twin
        goals mirror the priorities expressed by policymakers. Environmental health
        and ecosystem vitality are gauged using 25 indicators tracked in six well-established
        policy categories: Environmental Health (Environmental Burden of Disease,
        Water, and Air Pollution), Air Pollution (effects on ecosystems), Water (effects
        on ecosystems), Biodiversity and Habitat, Productive Natural Resources (Forestry,
        Fisheries, and Agriculture), and Climate Change. The 2008 EPI utilizes a proximity-to-target
        methodology in which performance on each indicator is rated on a 0 to 100
        scale (100 represents at target). By identifying specific targets and measuring
        how close each country comes to them, the EPI provides a foundation for policy
        analysis and a context for evaluating performance. Issue-by-issue and aggregate
        rankings facilitate cross-country comparisons both globally and within relevant
        peer groups. The 2008 EPI is the result of collaboration among the Yale Center
        for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), Columbia University Center for International
        Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), World Economic Forum (WEF), and
        the Joint Research Centre (JRC), European Commission.","time_end":"2007-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","orbit_parameters":{},"id":"C179001707-SEDAC","has_formats":false,"original_format":"DIF10","collection_data_type":"SCIENCE_QUALITY","archive_center":"SEDAC","browse_flag":true,"online_access_flag":true,"links":[{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/browse#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/maps/epi/epi-environmental-performance-index-2008/epi2008-overall-score-thumbnail.jpg"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://doi.org/10.7927/H4HT2M77"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/epi-environmental-performance-index-2008/data-download"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/epi-environmental-performance-index-2008/maps"}]}'

        data set provides forest age map products at 1-km resolution for Canada and
        the United States (U.S.A.). These continental forest age maps were compiled
        from forest inventory data, historical fire data, optical satellite data,
        and the images from the NASA Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing
        System (LEDAPS) project. These input data products have various sources and
        creation dates as described in the source paper by Pan et al. (2011). Canadian
        maps were produced with data available through 2004 and U.S.A. maps with data
        available through 2006. A supplementary map of the standard deviations for
        age estimates was developed for quantifying uncertainty.Note that the Pan
        et al. (2011) paper is included as a companion file with this data set and
        was the source of descriptions in the guide.Forest age, implicitly reflecting
        the past disturbance legacy, is a simple and direct surrogate for the time
        since disturbance and may be used in various forest carbon analyses that concern
        the impact of disturbances. By combining geographic information about forest
        age with estimated carbon dynamics by forest type, it is possible to conduct
        a simple but powerful analysis of the net CO2 uptake by forests, and the potential
        for increasing (or decreasing) this rate as a result of direct human intervention
        in the disturbance/age status.","DOI":{"Authority":"https://doi.org","DOI":"10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1096"},"RelatedUrls":[{"Description":"This

        Expedited L1A Reconstructed Unprocessed Instrument Data is produced with the
        express purpose of providing the ASTER Science Team members and others, data
        of their particular interest in quick turn-around time from the moment the
        data are acquired. This is usually done to support on-going field calibration
        and validation efforts or to support emergency response to natural disasters
        when processed Level-1 data with minimum turn-around time would prove beneficial
        in initial damage or impact assessments. This data set is expected to be publicly
        available for a period of 30 days after which time it will be removed from
        the archive. This is done because the routinely processed (Production Data
        Set or PDS) version of this data set will be available from Japan in due course
        and available for search and order from the LP DAAC archives. ASTER Expedited
        Data Sets (EDS) serve the short-term requirements of a small group of scientists
        and fulfill immediate imagery needs during times of natural disasters.\r\n\r\nUsers
        are advised that ASTER SWIR data acquired from late April 2008 to the present
        exhibit anomalous saturation of values and anomalous striping. This effect
        is also present for some prior acquisition periods. Please refer to the ASTER
        SWIR User Advisory Document (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/aster/docs/ASTER_SWIR_User_Advisory_July%2018_08.pdf)
        for more details.\r\n\r\nThe general product description details as described
        for the ASTER Level 1A Data Set - Reconstructed, unprocessed Instrument Data
        apply to the expedited data set with a few notable exceptions. These include:\r\n\r\n•       The
        Expedited Level-1A data set does not contain the VNIR 3B  (aft-viewing) band\r\n•       This
        data set does not have short-term calibration for the Thermal Infrared (TIR)
        sensor\r\n•       The registration quality of this data set is likely to be
        lower, and also vary from scene to scene \r\n\r\nThe Level-0 data downlink
        from the Tracking Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) at White Sands, NM is
        received at the EOS Data Operations System (EDOS) facility at the Goddard
        Space Flight Center (GSFC). Following some pre-processing, EDOS directly transmits
        that data (via the GSFC DAAC) to LP DAAC where the data are processed and
        the level-1 EDS is produced. The ASTER Level-1AE product contains reconstructed,
        unprocessed instrument digital data derived from the telemetry streams of
        the 3 telescopes at their respective ground resolutions: Visible Near Infrared
        (VNIR), 15 m, Shortwave Infrared (SWIR), 30 m, and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
        90 m. There is no browse product provided for the expedited L1A data set.\r\n\r\nV003

        Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation
        Model (GDEM) was developed jointly by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration (NASA) and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry
        (METI).\r\n\r\nASTER is capable of collecting in-track stereo using nadir-
        and aft-looking near infrared cameras.  Since 2001, these stereo pairs have
        been used to produce single-scene (60- x 60-kilomenter (km)) digital elevation
        models (DEM) having vertical (root-mean-squared-error) accuracies generally
        between 10- and 25-meters (m). \r\n\r\nThe methodology used by Japan''s Sensor
        Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) to produce the ASTER GDEM involves
        automated processing of the entire ASTER Level-1A archive.  Stereo-correlation
        is used to produce over one million individual scene-based ASTER DEMs, to
        which cloud masking is applied to remove cloudy pixels.  All cloud-screened
        DEMS are stacked and residual bad values and outliers are removed.  Selected
        data are averaged to create final pixel values, and residual anomalies are
        corrected before partitioning the data into 1° x 1° tiles.\r\n\r\nThe ASTER
        GDEM covers land surfaces between 83°N and 83°S and is comprised of 22,702
        tiles.  Tiles that contain at least 0.01% land area are included.  The ASTER
        GDEM is distributed as Geographic Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF) files
        with geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude).  The data are posted on
        a 1 arc-second (approximately 30–m at the equator) grid and referenced to
        the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/ 1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96)
        geoid.  \r\n\r\nWhile the ASTER GDEM 2 benefits from substantial improvements
        over GDEM 1, users are nonetheless advised that the products still may contain
        anomalies and artifacts that will reduce its usability for certain applications,
        because they can introduce large elevation errors on local scales. The data
        are provided “as is” and neither NASA nor METI/ERSDAC will be responsible
        for any damages resulting from use of the data.\r\n\r\nV002 data set release

        MODIS/Aqua Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 1km (MYD021KM) product contains
        calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 discrete bands located
        in the 0.4 to 14.4 micron region of electromagnetic spectrum. These data are
        generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance which during processing
        converted to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr). In addition, the Earth Bi-directional
        Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) may be determined for the solar reflective
        bands (1-19, 26) through knowledge of the solar irradiance (e.g., determined
        from MODIS solar diffuser data, and from the target illumination geometry).  Additional
        data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration
        data.\n\nVisible, shortwave infrared, and near infrared measurements are only
        made during the daytime, while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands
        20-25, 27-36) are measured continuously.\n\nThe Shortname for this product
        is MYD021KM and is stored in the Earth Observing System Hierarchical Data
        Format (HDF-EOS).\n\nEnvironmental information derived from MODIS L1B measurements
        will offer a comprehensive and unprecedented look at terrestrial, atmospheric,
        and ocean phenomenology for a wide and diverse community of users throughout
        the world.\n\nSee the MODIS Characterization Support Team webpage for more

        AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard
        deviations and input counts.  Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours
        for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local
        time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time)
        orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward
        (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded
        cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The
        two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3
        files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always
        coincident in time.  The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the
        date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map
        with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered.
        This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the
        right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding
        scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level
        3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths
        where there is no coverage for that day.The geophysical parameters have been
        averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude
        and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point
        mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard
        deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides
        the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean
        and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products.The
        thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air
        Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause
        Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud
        Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity,
        Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.The trace gases parameters are:
        Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone.The
        actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the
        Processing File Description document.(The Shortname for this product is AIRX3STD).","orbit_parameters":{},"id":"C1200187767-EDF_OPS","has_formats":true,"original_format":"ECHO10","archive_center":"GESDISC","browse_flag":false,"online_access_flag":true,"links":[{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"ftp://acdisc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/data/s4pa/Aqua_AIRS_Level3/AIRX3STD.006/"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/mirador/homepageAlt.pl?keyword=AIRX3STD"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/SSW/#keywords=AIRX3STD006"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/#utf8=%E2%9C%93&spatial_map=satellite&spatial_type=rectangle&keywords=GES_DISC_AIRX3STD_V006"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://disc1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/wms_airs?service=WMS&version=1.1.1&request=GetCapabilities"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://disc1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/wms_airs?service=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&SRS=EPSG:4326&WIDTH=720&HEIGHT=360&LAYERS=AIRX3STD_TOTH2OVAP_A&TRANSPARENT=TRUE&FORMAT=image/png&bbox=-180,-90,180,90"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://acdisc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/wcsAIRSL3?service=WCS&version=1.0.0&request=GetCapabilities"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://acdisc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/wcsAIRSL3?service=WCS&version=1.0.0&request=GetCoverage&CRS=EPSG:4326&format=netCDF&resx=1.0&resy=1.0&BBOX=-179.5,-89.5,179.5,89.5&Coverage=AIRX3STD:CO_VMR_A&Time=2013-08-11"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/index.shtml"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"ftp://acdisc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa/Aqua_AIRS_Level3/AIRX3STD.006/doc/README.AIRS_V6.pdf"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"ftp://acdisc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa//Aqua_AIRS_Level3/AIRX3STD.006/doc/README.AIRS_V6.pdf"}]}'
